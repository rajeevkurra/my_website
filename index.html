				<p>I'd like to introduce myself as Rajeev Kurra, a sophomore in the College of Engineering at the <a href=https://wisc.edu>University of Wisconsin-Madison</a>. I've always had a creative streak and a desire to work with engineering and mechanics. My initial interest in engineering did not fade, but rather grew into an almost insatiable desire. As I believe that the only way to achieve the goal is to adopt a result-oriented attitude that is reflected in accountability. As a result, I developed a passion for computer science engineering and a desire to use it to optimize and amplify my efforts in technology research, economic solutions, and research. I want to put what I've learned into practice.
