				<p> I traveled to New Orleans, Louisiana, in the summer of 2022. I was in town for the Fourth of July, and I saw fireworks explode in the sky. I've taken a cruise ship. The cruise lasted about 40 minutes and included dinner. I've also been to the <a href="https://www.lastateparks.com/parks-preserves/fontainebleau-state-park"> Fontainebleau Beach Resort</a>, which was wonderful.</p>

				<p> My parents took me to Seattle for a holiday vacation when I was in grade ten. I visited the Discovery Park Loop, which featured a lovely pop-up sky restaurant where they would transport a group of people into the sky and serve food. I've also seen the must-see <a href="https://www.spaceneedle.com"> Space Needle</a> in Seattle. It was a fantastic childhood memory of mine.</p>
